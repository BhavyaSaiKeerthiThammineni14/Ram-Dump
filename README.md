**Ram Dump**

This project provides a unified tool for capturing memory dumps (RAM snapshots) across various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. A memory dump is a valuable forensic and debugging aid, offering a snapshot of a system's memory state at a specific point in time.

**Features:**

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, eliminating the need for separate tools for each OS.
- **Modular Design:** Facilitates future expansion to support additional operating systems.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Offers a user-friendly and efficient way to initiate memory dumps.
- **Forensic Awareness:** Follows best practices to preserve evidence integrity when collecting memory dumps for forensic purposes (consider adding specific details about these practices in the future).

**Installation:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies for each supported operating system. Common requirements might include administrator privileges and specific system libraries. Provide clear instructions on identifying and installing these dependencies.
2. **Download:** Clone or download the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhavyaSaiKeerthiThammineni14/Ram-Dump.git
